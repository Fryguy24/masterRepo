The best thing for me is the enormous middle drawer that holds everything you use all the time and it's right
 at eye level so you don't have to move everything to find what you need. Plus it's has great lighting. 
 The freezer is also so large that we haven't filled it yet. We bought this as a Christmas gift for ourselves

we have had the washer and dryer for about 2-months and probably average one of two loads a day.. As other 
reviewers have mentioned, the display panel on this washer is difficult to read depending on the light source 
available. However once you get used to the operation of the washer you realize that you don't really need 
to adjust the settings via the panel that often anyway. We just purchased a LED light with a magnetic base 
and a flexible neck so we can direct light to the Washer or Dryer display panel when needed.", 8, 1);

 washer is a winner. This machine has an option that allows you to pause the wash and add an item without 
 having to cancel the cycle and start over. The app is very easy to set up. It allows you to pick your wash 
cycle options right from your phone. It also integrates easily with Amazon Alexa so you can check the status
of your washer by just using your voice. The app also lets you see the time remaining on the wash cycle and 
it even alerts you when the machine is finished. The machine is so quiet that you really need to be right next 
to it to hear it running. This is ideal if your laundry room is near you bedroom. I like that it has a tub 
clean reminder. I was always forgetting to run the cycle on my old machine. There is an indicator light that 
illuminates on the control panel and the app also sends a notification. The only negative thing I have to say 
about this machine is that the control panel is difficult to read. The panel has small white lettering on a 
glossy black background. There are small LEDs that light up next to the selected option. I think a better 
design would be to light up the actual words so you could see at a glance what the machine was set to. 
Overall this is a great machine. I'm very happy with it.", 8, 1);
